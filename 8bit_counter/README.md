Design an 8-bit synchronous counter. The counter should support synchronous reset 
and synchronous load/preset feature to load an 8-bit input synchronously. The counter 
output is decoded to produce a pulse tcount when the count reaches 255. The output is 
only this signal.Write a testbench that would work for both functional simulation and timing simulation.
